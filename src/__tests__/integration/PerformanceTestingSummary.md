## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. SessionsHistoryScreen Component Optimization
**File:** `src/components/SessionsHistoryScreen.tsx`

**Optimizations:**
- **Memoized Date Ranges**: Pre-compute date ranges once per component mount
- **Optimized Filtering**: Use for-loop instead of Array.filter() for better performance with large datasets
- **Early Returns**: Avoid unnecessary processing for 'all' filter
- **Switch Statement**: More efficient than if-else chains for filter type checking

```typescript
// Before: Computed on every filter
const filteredSessions = useMemo(() => {
  if (activeFilter === 'all') return sessions;
  
  let dateRange: { startDate: Date; endDate: Date };
  if (activeFilter === 'lastWeek') {
    dateRange = getLastWeekDateRange(); // Computed every time
  }
  // ...
}, [sessions, activeFilter]);

// After: Pre-computed and cached
const dateRanges = useMemo(() => ({
  lastWeek: getLastWeekDateRange(),
  lastMonth: getLastMonthDateRange(),
}), []); // Only compute once

const filteredSessions = useMemo(() => {
  if (activeFilter === 'all') return sessions;
  
  // Use pre-computed ranges and optimized loop
  const filtered: SessionObject[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < sessions.length; i++) {
    // More efficient than Array.filter()
  }
}, [sessions, activeFilter, dateRanges]);
```

### 2. FilterControls Component Optimization
**File:** `src/components/FilterControls.tsx`

**Optimizations:**
- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed
- **Custom Comparison**: Only re-renders when activeFilter or onFilterChange changes

```typescript
export default memo(FilterControls, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return (
    prevProps.activeFilter === nextProps.activeFilter &&
    prevProps.onFilterChange === nextProps.onFilterChange
  );
});
```

### 3. Performance Utilities

**Features:**
- **Performance Measurement**: Utilities for measuring execution time
- **Realistic Data Generation**: Creates test data with realistic distributions
- **Memory Usage Testing**: Validates efficient memory usage patterns
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests performance with problematic data
