# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a dedicated sessions history page to the existing time tracker application. The page will provide users with a comprehensive view of their work sessions with filtering capabilities to help them analyze their time tracking data more effectively. Users will be able to filter sessions by time periods (last week, last month) or view all sessions, making it easier to review their work patterns and generate reports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a time tracker user, I want to access a dedicated sessions history page, so that I can view my work sessions in a focused interface separate from the main tracking screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the sessions history page THEN the system SHALL display all completed work sessions in chronological order (most recent first)
2. WHEN the sessions history page loads THEN the system SHALL show session details including date, clock-in time, clock-out time, and total hours worked
3. IF there are no sessions to display THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN the page is loading session data THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a time tracker user, I want to filter my sessions by last week, so that I can quickly review my recent work activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Last Week" filter button THEN the system SHALL display only sessions from the past 7 days
2. WHEN the "Last Week" filter is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the filter button to indicate it's selected
3. WHEN sessions are filtered by last week AND there are no sessions in that period THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN the last week filter is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the chronological ordering of displayed sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a time tracker user, I want to filter my sessions by last month, so that I can review my work patterns over a longer time period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Last Month" filter button THEN the system SHALL display only sessions from the past 30 days
2. WHEN the "Last Month" filter is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the filter button to indicate it's selected
3. WHEN sessions are filtered by last month AND there are no sessions in that period THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message
4. WHEN the last month filter is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the chronological ordering of displayed sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a time tracker user, I want to view all my sessions without any time-based filtering, so that I can see my complete work history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the sessions history page THEN the system SHALL default to showing all sessions without any filters applied
2. WHEN the user clicks an "All Sessions" or similar button THEN the system SHALL remove any active filters and display all sessions
3. WHEN no filters are active THEN the system SHALL not highlight any filter buttons
4. WHEN displaying all sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological ordering (most recent first)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a time tracker user, I want the filter buttons to be easily accessible at the top right of the sessions page, so that I can quickly switch between different time period views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sessions history page loads THEN the system SHALL display filter buttons in the top right area of the screen
2. WHEN filter buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL show "Last Week" and "Last Month" options as specified
3. WHEN a user taps a filter button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback (button press animation)
4. WHEN filter buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are easily tappable with appropriate touch targets
5. IF the screen size is small THEN the system SHALL ensure filter buttons remain accessible and don't overlap with other content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a time tracker user, I want the sessions history page to integrate seamlessly with the existing app navigation, so that I can easily move between the main tracker and history views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the main time tracker screen THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to navigate to the sessions history page
2. WHEN the user is on the sessions history page THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to navigate back to the main tracker screen
3. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the app's consistent visual design and user experience
4. WHEN the user navigates to the sessions history page THEN the system SHALL preserve any active time tracking session on the main screen
