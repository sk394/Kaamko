# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple React Native time tracking application built with Expo. The app will allow users to clock in and out of work sessions, track their hours, and maintain a history of all sessions. All data will be stored locally on the device using AsyncStorage, with no backend integration required for the initial version. The app is designed to be simple, clean, and functional on iOS devices using Expo Go.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clock in to start tracking my work time, so that I can accurately record when I begin working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is not currently clocked in THEN the system SHALL display a "Clock In" button
2. WHEN the user taps the "Clock In" button THEN the system SHALL record the current timestamp
3. WHEN the user successfully clocks in THEN the system SHALL display the current status as "Clocked In at [time]"
4. WHEN the user clocks in THEN the system SHALL persist the clock-in state using AsyncStorage
5. IF the user is already clocked in THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Clock In" button

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clock out to stop tracking my work time, so that I can complete my work session and see how long I worked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is currently clocked in THEN the system SHALL display a "Clock Out" button
2. WHEN the user taps the "Clock Out" button THEN the system SHALL record the current timestamp as clock-out time
3. WHEN the user clocks out THEN the system SHALL calculate the total hours worked for the session
4. WHEN the user clocks out THEN the system SHALL save the complete session to AsyncStorage with date, clock-in time, clock-out time, and hours worked
5. WHEN the user clocks out THEN the system SHALL reset the status to "Not Clocked In"
6. IF the user is not clocked in THEN the system SHALL NOT display the "Clock Out" button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current work session status, so that I know whether I'm currently tracking time and when I started.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL check AsyncStorage for existing clock-in state
2. IF the user is clocked in THEN the system SHALL display "Clocked In at [time]" with the actual clock-in time
3. IF the user is not clocked in THEN the system SHALL display "Not Clocked In"
4. WHEN the user's status changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the displayed status
5. WHEN displaying clock-in time THEN the system SHALL format the time in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my work session history, so that I can review my past work hours and track my productivity over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the app THEN the system SHALL display a list of past work sessions
2. WHEN displaying session history THEN the system SHALL show date, clock-in time, clock-out time, and total hours for each session
3. WHEN displaying session history THEN the system SHALL order sessions by date with most recent first
4. IF there are no past sessions THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no history
5. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve session history from AsyncStorage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my work sessions to be automatically saved, so that I don't lose my time tracking data if the app closes or my device restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clocks in THEN the system SHALL immediately save the clock-in state to AsyncStorage
2. WHEN the user clocks out THEN the system SHALL save the complete session data to AsyncStorage
3. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL restore the user's clock-in state from AsyncStorage
4. WHEN saving session data THEN the system SHALL use the format: {"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "clockIn": "ISO string", "clockOut": "ISO string", "hours": number}
5. IF AsyncStorage operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work seamlessly on my iOS device through Expo Go, so that I can use it without complex installation procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Expo Go
2. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL NOT use any native modules that break Expo compatibility
3. WHEN the app is tested THEN the system SHALL function properly on iOS devices
4. WHEN using UI components THEN the system SHALL use Expo's built-in components or compatible libraries like React Native Paper
5. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, simple interface with clear navigation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can easily track my time without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the main screen THEN the system SHALL display the current status prominently
2. WHEN the user needs to take action THEN the system SHALL show clearly labeled buttons (Clock In/Clock Out)
3. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL use a simple, clean design with good contrast
4. WHEN showing session history THEN the system SHALL present the information in an easy-to-read format
5. WHEN the user interacts with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
