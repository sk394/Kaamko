## üìã Setup Checklist

### Prerequisites:
- [ ] Node.js 20.x or higher installed locally
- [ ] Expo account created
- [ ] EAS CLI installed locally: `npm install -g @expo/eas-cli`
- [ ] Project configured for EAS: `eas build:configure`
- [ ] Apple Developer account (for iOS)
- [ ] Google Play Developer account (for Android)

**Note**: The global `expo-cli` has been deprecated. Use `npx expo` for Expo CLI commands and `eas` for builds/submissions.

### GitHub Repository Setup:
- [ ] Add all required secrets (at minimum `EXPO_TOKEN`)
- [ ] Enable GitHub Actions in repository settings
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules for `main` branch
- [ ] Configure auto-merge for dependabot PRs (optional)

### EAS Configuration:
- [ ] Configure `eas.json` with build profiles
- [ ] Set up credentials: `eas credentials`
- [ ] Test build locally: `eas build --platform all --profile preview`

### App Store Setup:
- [ ] iOS: Set up app in App Store Connect
- [ ] Android: Set up app in Google Play Console
- [ ] Configure app store metadata, screenshots, etc.

## üîß Build Profiles in `eas.json`

Make sure your `eas.json` includes these profiles:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Release"
      },
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

## üö¶ Deployment Workflow

### Automatic Deployments:

1. **Development/Feature Work**:
   - Push to feature branches ‚Üí Quality checks run
   - Open PR to `develop` ‚Üí Quality checks + preview build
   - Merge to `develop` ‚Üí Preview build created

2. **Production Release**:
   - Merge `develop` to `main` ‚Üí Production build created + Expo OTA update
   - Create release on GitHub ‚Üí Production build + auto-submit to app stores

### Manual Deployments:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **Manual Deployment** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Choose your options:
   - Platform (iOS, Android, or both)
   - Profile (development, preview, production)
   - Version bump (optional)
   - Submit to stores (optional)
5. Click **Run workflow**

## üìä Monitoring and Notifications

### Build Status:
- Check the **Actions** tab for workflow status
- Build summaries are automatically generated
- PR comments include build information

### App Store Status:
- iOS: Check App Store Connect for submission status
- Android: Check Google Play Console for submission status

### Expo Dashboard:
- Visit https://expo.dev/accounts/[your-account]/projects/kaamko-app
- Monitor builds, submissions, and OTA updates

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails with "EXPO_TOKEN not found"**:
   - Make sure you've added the `EXPO_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repository settings

2. **iOS Submission Fails**:
   - Verify `EXPO_APPLE_ID` and `EXPO_APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` are set
   - Check that your Apple Developer account has necessary permissions

3. **Android Build Fails**:
   - Ensure your `eas.json` is properly configured
   - Check EAS credentials: `eas credentials`

4. **Tests Fail**:
   - Run tests locally: `npm test`
   - Check for missing dependencies or configuration issues

### Getting Help:
- Check workflow logs in the Actions tab
- Review EAS build logs in Expo dashboard
- Consult Expo documentation: https://docs.expo.dev/

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Branch Strategy**:
   - Use feature branches for development
   - Merge to `develop` for testing
   - Merge to `main` for production releases

2. **Version Management**:
   - Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
   - Increment versions for app store releases
   - Use build numbers for internal builds

3. **Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Test on multiple devices/simulators
   - Use preview builds for stakeholder review

4. **Security**:
   - Keep secrets secure and rotate regularly
   - Review dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Monitor build logs for sensitive information

## üì± App Store Submission Process

### iOS App Store:
1. Build completes ‚Üí Uploaded to App Store Connect
2. Review build in TestFlight
3. Submit for App Store review
4. Monitor review status
5. Release when approved

### Google Play Store:
1. Build completes ‚Üí Uploaded to Google Play Console
2. Review app bundle in Internal Testing
3. Promote to Production or submit for review
4. Monitor review status
5. Release when approved

## ü§ù Contributing to CI/CD

When modifying workflows:
1. Test changes in a feature branch first
2. Use workflow dispatch for testing
3. Monitor build times and optimize if needed
4. Update this documentation for any changes
5. Consider backward compatibility
